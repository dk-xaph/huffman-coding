# huffman-coding
A compression and decompression program based on Huffman Coding written in C++. This implementation was my C++ project back at the university.

## Usage

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/xaphoon/huffman-coding.git
cd huffman-coding
```

Build code using Makefile:

```
make
```

Compression:

```
./huffman -c -f <file to compress> -o <output file>
```

Decompression:

```
./huffman -u -f <file to decompress> -o <output file>
```
